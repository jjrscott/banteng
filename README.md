# banteng



Banteng is an attempt at a parser that uses JSON encoded [BNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backusâ€“Naur_form) grammars to parse text into JSON. If this ever goes anywhere `banteng.py` would only be a reference implementation, the [grammar format](grammar.md) would contain all canonical definitions.

### Notes

The `grammars` folder contains a few examples from an older project which used grammars in their original BNF form. I've dded them here along with a non-functional conversion to JSON. It's worth noting that in the old project the hardcoded BNF parser only ocupied nearly 300 lines.
